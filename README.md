## 🧰 Technical Overview

### ✔ Language
- Pure C — no external libraries

### ✔ Storage
- CSV-based file handling
- CRUD operations implemented manually through file read/write

### ✔ Input Handling
- Uses safe `fgets` with buffer size limits
- Removes newline characters using `strcspn`

### ✔ File Update Method
For delete/update operations:
1. Read original file  
2. Write required data to a temporary file `tmp.csv`  
3. Replace the original file using `remove()` + `rename()`  

### ✔ Auto-Increment IDs
IDs are generated by scanning the file for the highest ID and adding 1.
